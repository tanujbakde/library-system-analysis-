## Reports

-- **Database Schema**: Detailed table structures and relationships.
-- **Data Analysis**: Insights into book categories, employee salaries, member registration trends, 
-- and issued books.
-- **Summary Reports**: Aggregated data on high-demand books and employee performance.

## Conclusion

-- This project demonstrates the application of SQL skills in creating and managing a library management system. 
-- It includes database setup, 
-- data manipulation, and advanced querying, providing a solid foundation -- for data management and analysis.
